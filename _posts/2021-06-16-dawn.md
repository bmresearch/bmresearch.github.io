## Prelude

A while ago blockmountain was born with the goal of being our venture into development of tools related to cryptocurrency trading, at first glance it all changed when we decided we'd like to contribute to the Solana ecosystem.

Blockmountain as an idea appeared around two years ago, the name being an ode to the place where both of its founding members went to University. The premise of it was to be an alias, and possibly much more, under which we would go on to develop tools for a number of different use cases, from cryptocurrency algorithmic trading to applications that would overcome the inconveniences that come with using multiple centralized exchanges.

Sometime last year we started hacking on a project codenamed <i>Citadel</i>, the premise was to have a single desktop application that featured several centralized exchanges with features their applications don't have, in doing this I would add a different kind of development experience to my background, and Tiago would strengthen his .Net experience with a different type of application.

When the Solana Season Hackathon was first announced I suggested we contribute, our first discussion was around building a DeFi asset manager, integrating [Serum](https://projectserum.com/), [Raydium](https://raydium.io/) and possibly other protocols, we could easily leverage what we had been building using .Net towards this new application for the Solana ecosystem. It was at this point our ideas were derailed by the lack of tooling available for the .Net community, so we thought, why don't we jump-start this community ourselves?

## Kickstarting Solnet

Since the end of the hackathon we have taken on roles other than just dishing out code for an early product. While attempting to build a community around Solnet we discovered how easy it is for crypto projects to get swarmed by discord bots. But not all community building efforts are derailed, as we found other SDK developers who are eager to discuss and share ideas regarding each SDK implementation. Although we are proud of what we accomplished we know that we are capable of much more <i>and</i> much better.

However, we should strive to conquer that which is nearest. In the present, this means having a stable core SDK built for .Net and to bootstrap an ecosystem of libraries around it which implement the most commonly used third party programs. That said, as of this writing Solnet has full API coverage*.

Now that we all know what the <i>big</i> and <i>medium picture</i> is, we spent several hours tinkering and planning the next steps. For now, we made the commitment for two big milestones in the next 3 months:

Milestone 1:

- Finish implementing the optional parameters. *(Commitment parameter isn't available in all methods).

- Clean up the transaction API and its workflow.

- Completely implement the System and Token programs.

- More documentation (examples, small guides, and real use-cases).


Milestone 2:

- Implement the Serum client.

- Serum client documentation!

## Future

While we have taken a big detour on our path towards our <i>big picture</i>, the roads we travel still arrive at the same destination. The money legos are being built on Solana for a DeFi ecosystem to thrive and challenge the industry as we know it. We still want to build the ill-defined desktop application that integrates several protocols.

At first glance, we thought it all changed. In the end, nothing did.
